-- VR: the conductor -- one call per game frame that runs the whole

-- The shape of a VR frame, from the pipeline's update hook (which ticks
-- every frame whatever is on the stack, which is exactly what a headset
-- needs -- the world must keep arriving through menus, dialogs and
-- battles):
--
--   poll the runtime's events (begin the session when it says READY)
--   xrWaitFrame            <- BLOCKS until the headset wants a frame;
--                             with vsync handed off (set to 0 while the
--                             session runs) this is what paces the whole
--                             app at headset rate, while FixedStep keeps
--                             the game's own logic at its 60 Hz
--   locate the two eyes
--   render the world once per eye (VoxelScene.render's `eyes` path:
--     shared shadow map, shared pose capture, per-eye cameras from VRRig)
--   blit each eye canvas into its swapchain image (VRGL)
--   copy the window's front buffer into the UI quad when a menu, dialog,
--     battle or wipe is what the flat screen is showing
--   xrEndFrame with the projection layer and/or the quad
--
-- WHICH VR YOU GET mirrors the VOXEL ladder, deliberately: on the orbit
-- rungs the world is a TABLETOP DIORAMA pinned below and ahead of where
-- your head started -- lean in, walk around it; on 1ST you stand inside
-- at life scale, the HMD steers FirstPerson's yaw and pitch, and FreeMove
-- walks where you look exactly as it does on the flat screen. A STAGED
-- FIGHT takes the camera from both: the headset snaps -- through a fade
-- to black and back -- to the flat battle's own over-the-shoulder seat
-- (VRRig.battleMount), and returns the same way when the fight ends;
-- the 2D battle screen lights up on the POKEDEX in the tracked left
-- hand (lib/Pokedex.lua) and NO floating panel is submitted at all --
-- the fight itself owns the view. The flat window keeps
-- running as the mirror (left eye when the world is up), so menus stay
-- usable at the desk and every existing input keeps working alongside
-- the XR controllers.
--
-- Failure is a status, never a crash: no runtime, no headset, no GL
-- interop, or a mid-session loss all land back on the flat screen with
-- the reason readable off VR.status().

--                 so it grid-walks the diorama and free-walks 1ST);
--                 A/B are A/B; either trigger is START; clicking the
--                 LEFT stick steps the VOXEL angle ladder exactly as
--                 the "3" key (and the pad's SELECT) does.
--   1ST only      right stick left/right SNAP-TURNS 45 degrees a flick.
--   diorama only  right stick up/down zooms the model; squeezing a grip
--                 and moving that hand up or down drags the whole table
--                 with it.
